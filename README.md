# Once More, with Feeling: My Definitive Rust Journey

This is my third, and final, attempt at mastering Rust. I started back in April 2024, stopped, started again, and stopped again. This time is different.

**My "Why":**
- Rust is the language of modern cryptography and zero-knowledge systems. To build what I want to build, proficiency in Rust is non-negotiable.
- I love the language's principles of safety, performance, and concurrency.
- A deep understanding of Rust is critical for my career goals in the ZK space.

**My Promise:**
From today, September 10th, 2025, I commit to consistent, project-based learning. No more passive reading. No more tutorial loops. I will build, I will struggle, and I will push code every day to document my progress. This repository is my public promise to myself.
Let's go!
